# rnbo-step-sequencer
a step sequencer built with Max and RNBO. WIP, still learning.  
  
    
  
TODO:  
-  
- make custom checkmark, draw color, (hopefully darker and lighter shades based off veloctiy)  
- make velocity input somehow
- make a playhead that draws the current step  
- get a clock message from rnbo to sync  
- trigger sounds
