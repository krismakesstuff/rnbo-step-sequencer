# rnbo-step-sequencer
a step sequencer built with Max and RNBO. WIP, still learning.  
  
    
  
TODO:  
-  
- make velocity input somehow, maybe mess with a canvas as input. Store position of lines and playback inro RNBO device as notes    
- make it pretty  
- click is triggering weirdly  
- add scales and octaves to "quantize the canvas". add select elements  
- add presets of beats, add select element  
- add osc filter
